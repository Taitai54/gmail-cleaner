## 🚀 Quick Start

### Easiest Way: Double-Click Launcher

**macOS:**
1. Double-click **`Gmail Cleaner.app`** in Finder
2. Follow any setup prompts
3. Your browser opens automatically at http://localhost:8766

**Windows:**
1. Double-click **`run.bat`** (or run **`create-windows-shortcut.ps1`** once to create a desktop shortcut)
2. Follow any setup prompts
3. Your browser opens automatically at http://localhost:8766

The launchers will check for:
- ✅ `uv` package manager (and guide you to install it if needed)
- ✅ `credentials.json` (and show setup instructions if missing)
- ✅ Whether the app is already running (just opens browser in that case)

### Prerequisites

1. **Install `uv`** (modern Python package manager - faster than pip):
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

2. **Get Google OAuth credentials** (see setup below)

### Manual Run (if you prefer Terminal/Command Prompt)

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd gmail-cleaner

# Run the app (uv installs dependencies automatically)
uv run python main.py
```

Then open http://localhost:8766 in your browser.

## 🔑 Google OAuth Setup (One-Time, ~5 minutes)

You need to create your own Google OAuth credentials (free):

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" → "New Project"
3. Enter project name (e.g., "Gmail Cleaner")
4. Click "Create"

### Step 2: Enable Gmail API

1. In your project, go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
2. Search for "Gmail API"
3. Click "Gmail API" → "Enable"

### Step 3: Create OAuth Credentials

1. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
3. If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen:
   - User Type: **External**
   - App name: "Gmail Cleaner" (or any name)
   - User support email: Your email
   - Developer contact: Your email
   - Click "Save and Continue"
   - Scopes: Skip this (click "Save and Continue")
   - Test users: Add your Gmail address(es)
   - Click "Save and Continue"

4. Back to Create OAuth client ID:
   - Application type: **Desktop app**
   - Name: "Gmail Cleaner Desktop"
   - Click "Create"

5. Download the credentials:
   - Click "Download JSON"
   - **Save as `credentials.json` in the project folder** (same folder as `main.py`)

### Step 4: First Run

1. Run the application (double-click launcher or `uv run python main.py`)
2. Your browser will open for Google sign-in
3. Click your account
4. Click "Continue" on the warning (this is your own app)
5. Grant permissions
6. Done! The app is now authorized

**Note:** The warning about "Google hasn't verified this app" is normal - it's YOUR app, so you can trust it.

## 📖 How to Use

1. Sign in with your first Gmail account (automatic on first run)
2. Click **Accounts** button in the header

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

# Optional: Change port (default: 8766)
PORT=8766

WEB_AUTH=false

# Optional: OAuth callback settings (for Docker/port mapping)
OAUTH_PORT=8767

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "credentials.json not found"
- Make sure you've downloaded credentials from Google Cloud Console
- Save it as `credentials.json` (not `client_secret_xxx.json`)
- Place it in the project root folder (same folder as `main.py`)

### "uv: command not found"
- Install uv using the commands in Prerequisites section above
- On macOS/Linux, restart your terminal after installing
- On Windows, restart Command Prompt after installing

### "Token has been expired or revoked"
- The app will automatically prompt you to re-authorize
- Alternatively, delete `token_*.json` files and `accounts.json`
- Restart the app and sign in again

### "Port already in use"
- Another instance is running — check http://localhost:8766
- Or change the port: `PORT=8001 uv run python main.py`

### macOS: "Gmail Cleaner.app can't be opened"
- Right-click the app → "Open" → "Open" (to bypass Gatekeeper first time)
- Or run: `xattr -cr "Gmail Cleaner.app"`

### Windows: ".bat file opens and closes immediately"
- Right-click `run.bat` → "Edit" to see error messages
- Or run from Command Prompt to see output
